## Welcome to My Python Repository!

Here you will find my Python notes related to Data Structures & Algorithms, covering different ways of organizing the data, and some important categories of algorithms that are used to manipulate the data (searching, sorting, inserting, updadating and deleting). As also, some file management and file analysis technics.
